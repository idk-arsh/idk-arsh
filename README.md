## üó∫ Current Projects

- **Course Finder**  
Finding the right learning path is often a challenge. Course Finder simplifies this process by curating courses based on user preferences, delivering tailored recommendations in seconds. It‚Äôs designed to be ad-free and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to start learning immediately. The platform's smart filtering algorithm ensures users are matched with courses that best suit their needs and learning goals.

- **Mental Health Chatbot**  
Mental health is important, and having a supportive companion at all times can make a difference. This chatbot engages users in conversations, offering both thoughtful and playful responses to help lighten the mood. Whether it's providing soothing advice or just chatting casually, this AI-driven tool is designed to provide emotional support 24/7.

- **Dog Breed Identifier**  
No need to memorize every dog breed! The Dog Breed Identifier uses a trained model to recognize breeds from images, offering valuable information to dog lovers and professionals alike. Whether you're trying to identify a pet or learning about different breeds for adoption, this tool makes it easy. It‚Äôs particularly useful for those importing dogs from different regions, ensuring pets can adapt to their new environments.

- **Movie Recommendation**  
Can't decide what to watch next? This movie recommendation system takes the guesswork out of your movie nights. By selecting your preferred genres, you'll receive a curated list of the best films from 1970 to 2023. The model achieves high precision by using the Surprise library, ensuring users are matched with movies that fit their tastes‚Äîprocessing recommendations with lightning speed.

- **Gym Workout App**
  In today's gyms, people often struggle to decide which workout to do, especially when equipment is in use or when unsure about the right exercise for their fitness goals. To solve this problem, I developed a Gym Workout App that provides users with personalized workout recommendations based on various factors.

## üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

Hi, I'm Arshdeep Singh Ghotra, but feel free to call me Arsh. Some friends call me Ash‚Äîyou can take a guess why! üòâ

I started my journey with a Data Analyst internship in my freshman year. Currently, I work at my university library as an Advanced Technology Assistant, focusing on data normalization and website development. I've also secured an IT internship for the fall, centered around database management, and I couldn't be more excited to start.

As a passionate student at Indiana State University, I‚Äôm constantly improving my skills in Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I‚Äôm driven by a deep curiosity to solve real-world problems and simplify life through technology. My main areas of interest include Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Software Engineering.

I thrive on turning ideas into reality‚Äîwhether it's developing smart solutions with Node.js or creating seamless experiences using modern JavaScript frameworks like React. I also love delving into data, exploring insights through analysis, and transforming those insights into impactful recommendations and visualizations.
